# DOM EVENTS LAB

## This Lab is a deliverable.

<br>Everybody loves choices! You have not one, but TWO(!) possible options for the DOM EVENTS Lab:<br><br>

Please choose ONE of the following options to submit for your deliverable:
1. Do <a href="dom-practice-lab-2a">these two mini projects</a> (a "Click Counter", and a "Morse Code Translator"), or
1. Do <a href="dom-practice-lab-2b">Part #2 of the DOM LAB</a> you already started (this is harder but you get to try lots of cool dom features!)

Please submit either one of the above two options, by posting a link to your solution in the deliverables. You can submit both as well if you really want to!<br><br>
